## Objective
Create a focused analysis of the Titanic dataset that would help you identify the most relevant features for survival prediction. Write a concise report (maximum 500 words, excluding graphs) that highlights key visualisations that would help you justify your feature selection decisions.

## Setup

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Conda installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the following command to create the environment using the `environment.yml` file:
   ```sh
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

4. Activate the newly created environment:
   ```sh
   conda activate <environment_name>
   ```

   Replace `<environment_name>` with the name specified in the `environment.yml` file.

The notebook is saved in the `notesbook` directory.
